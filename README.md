# Data Training
This section focuses on preparing the data for input into machine learning models and conducting the training of three different models: CNN, RNN, and Transformer.

## Model Types
The data will be trained using three different types of models:

1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
2. **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**
3. **Transformer**

## Data Domains
The data will be processed and inserted into the models in three different domains:

1. **Temporal Domain (Time)** - (training_time.ipynb)
   - Using raw data for training.

2. **Frequency Domain** - (training_frequency.ipynb)
   - Utilizing Power Spectral Density (Periodogram) for training.

3. **Time-Frequency Domain** - (training_time_frequency.ipynb)
   - Employing Spectrogram for training.
